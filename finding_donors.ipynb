    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "1) AdaBoost\n",
    "   \n",
    "      a) The AdaBoost algorithm is used in customer relationship management strategy,to predict customer churn and improve customer retention. [Reference](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~rlaz/PatternRecognition/slides/churn_adaboost.pdf)\n",
    "   \n",
    "      b) The model improves on shortcoming of weak learners such as decision trees, and are less prone to overfitting data, and is easy to implement. It also has a high degree of precision. [Reference](https://easyai.tech/en/ai-definition/adaboost/)\n",
    "  \n",
    "      c) It is susceptible to noise and outliers. [Reference](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/adaboost-classifier-python)\n",
    "   \n",
    "      d) This model is a good candidate for our problem as it offers high precision. Since it is important that we correctly identify individuals that have an incom >50k, we need a high precision model. It also improves upon simply using decision trees as it corrects the decision tree's weakness of often overfitting. AdaBoost is however susceptible to outliers, which might be of concern in our skewed features. However the outliers should have less of an effect because we have log transformed them.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2) SVM\n",
    "\n",
    "      a) SVM are often used in classifying images and classifying satellite data. [Reference](https://data-flair.training/blogs/applications-of-svm/)\n",
    "   \n",
    "      b) They are effective in high dimensional spaces-problems having many features. They also work well when there is a clear margin of separation between classes. [Reference1](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html#classification). [Reference2](https://medium.com/@dhiraj8899/top-4-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-support-vector-machine-or-svm-a3c06a2b107)\n",
    "   \n",
    "      c) They do not perform well when the number of features is more than the number of samples. [Reference](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html#classification)\n",
    "   \n",
    "      d) This model is a good candidate for our problem as it does well in high dimensional spaces. Since we have a lot of features, 103, we assume that this will be an effective model. SVM's also work well when there is a clear margin of separation between classes, which there is for our problem.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3) Random Forest\n",
    "\n",
    "      a) The algorithm is often used by banks to determine whether a customer is likely to pay off their loan. [Reference](https://builtin.com/data-science/random-forest-algorithm)\n",
    "      \n",
    "      b) They excel in data sets with high dimensionality. They are less prone to overfitting than decision trees.[Reference](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-advantages-and-disadvantages-for-a-random-forest-algorithm)\n",
    "      \n",
    "      c) They are hard to interpret, more so a black box solution. Need to optimize parameters such as number of trees.[Reference](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-advantages-and-disadvantages-for-a-random-forest-algorithm)\n",
    "      \n",
    "      d) Since we have a lot of paramters, the algorithm is well suited since it excels in high dimensionality. It is also less prone to overfitting than using a decision tree model. This will serve as a good base level model"

    "The SVM Classifier seems to have a slightly lower testing F score when compared to AdaBoost on a model trained on 100% of the training data, however it seems to be computationally heavier and inefficient as it's prediction time and training time is an order of magnitutde higher than AdaBoost. Hence this option is also discarded.\n",

Our skewed parameters are also log transformed in order to reduce the effect of outliers. This works perfectly with AdaBoost as it is usually susceptible to outliers. It is also les susceptible to overfit our data, unlike Random Forest and decision trees."

    "AdaBoost is a model based on the concept of 'Boosting'. Boosting is a type of method where multiple models or 'weak learners' are combined to make a final model or a 'Strong learner'. In training AdaBoost, each weak learner focuses on correctly classifying points misclassified but the previous weak learner. This carries on until all subsequent weak learners are trained.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a weak learner is trained on the data and a point is misclassified, it is made larger and it's weight is increased such that the subsequent weak learner focuses on correctly classifying the misclassified point. Once all the weak learners are trained on the data set, they are combined in terms of their weight, to form the final model. If a weak learner classifies most points correctly, it is given a high positive weight since it is doing it's job correctly. If a weak learner classifies most of the points wrong, it is given a negative weight since we want it to do the opposite of what it is currently doing. Through this process, the weights of all the weak learners are combined to create a final model.\n",
    "\n",
    "A prediction is made by this algorithm by comibining the weighted average of all the weak learners to create a strong learner, given a particular test data set. The output will be the result predicted by the strong learner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important paramters of Adaboost include base_estimator, which is the type of weak learner we choose to use; it is a decison tree my default. n_estimators is a paramter that decides the number of instances of our weak learner that we choose to use. if we choose 50 n_estimators then a final model will be made up of 50 instances of our weak learner.\n",

    "- Create a dictionary of parameters you wish to tune for the chosen model.\n",
    " - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.\n",
    " - **Note:** Avoid tuning the `max_features` parameter of your learner if that parameter is available!\n",

By focusing on the relationship between only a few crucial features and the target label we simplify our understanding of the phenomenon, which is most always a useful thing to do. In the case of this project, that means we wish to identify a small number of features that most strongly predict whether an individual makes at most or more than \\$50,000.\n",

    "2) Occupation: Higher paying jobs such as engineering and finance related jobs usually pay more than 50K while occupations such as in the cleaning industry, usually pay less. Therefore I believe Occupation to be the 2nd most important feature for prediction\n",

    "4) hours-per-week: In general, the higher someones hours per week, the higher their income. Someone with a part time job working less than 20 hrs a week is unlikely to have an income of more than 50k while someone working in excess of 40 hrs is more likely\n",
    "\n",

    "Three features, namely capital-gain, age and hours-per-week are present in both the graph above as well as my rankings. The capital-loss and education-num feature are present in the graph above, however were not present in my rankings. On further inspection it seems that the education-num feature corresponds education-level feature I have in my ranking, however it is just a numerical representation of the education-level feature, with a higher education level resulting in a higher education-num. The fact the education-num is consiedered a top 5 feature but education level is not, might be down to the fact that education-num had numerical inputs that were normalized but the education-level feature was just one-hot encoded.\n",
    "\n",
    "I failed to consider Capital-loss as one of the deciding features as I felt it wouldnt have as much an effect since people who had income exceeding 50k would usually have better assets providing better profits and hence be correlated to capital gains, while people earning less in general would have fewer, more risk averse assets and hence not many losses. However it seems that capital loss is in fact the most important feature in predcting income. Additionally I had occupation also listed in my top 5 rankings, but it fails to appear on the graph. I suspect this might be because of a wide variety of occupations present in the data and hence not much correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general I feel the features I chose based on intuition, were similar to the ones displayed on the graph, however my ranking of those features was different than that on the graph and I have gained more insight about the predictive features from the graph.\n",

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
